The Wavelet Synchrosqueezing Transform (WSST) is a method for analyzing 
2D images that combines the wavelet transform, a reallocation technique, 
and a clustering algorithm. It can separate and identify the wave-like 
components of an image, such as edges, textures, and patterns, and 
estimate their instantaneous wavevectors, which indicate the direction and 
frequency of the oscillations12.

The WSST works by first applying the wavelet transform to the image, which
 produces a time-scale representation of the image. Then, it uses a formula
  to compute the instantaneous frequency of each wavelet coefficient, 
  which is related to the local oscillation of the image. Next, it reassigns the 
  wavelet coefficients to new scales according to their instantaneous 
  frequencies, which results in a sharper and more focused representation. 
  Finally, it applies a clustering algorithm to group the coefficients into 
  different modes, each corresponding to a wave-like component of the 
  image12.

The WSST can be useful for applications such as image segmentation, 
denoising, compression, and feature extraction. It can also handle images
 with non-stationary or multi-directional components, which are challenging
  for traditional wavelet methods123.
